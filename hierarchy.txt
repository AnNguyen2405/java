That's an excellent question! Structuring your JavaFX project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is standard practice, and organizing it into separate packages is the correct way to implement this architecture.Since you are using a JavaFX template structure, your task is simply to create these new packages inside your main source folder.📦 Organizing Your Project into PackagesIn a standard Maven/JavaFX project, your main source code is under src/main/java. You should create the following three main sub-packages inside your base package (com.example.demo in your case) to represent the 3-Tiers:Package NameTierRole in Your ProjectmodelModel (Data/Business Logic)Holds your data classes (e.g., User.java), and the data access logic (the DAO classes that talk directly to MySQL).viewView (Presentation)Holds the FXML files and the main application entry point (the JavaFX window components).controllerController (Application Logic)Holds the classes that handle user input, update the Model, and communicate changes back to the View.Example Structure in Your IDEYour project hierarchy would look like this:src
└── main
    └── java
        └── com
            └── example
                └── demo  <-- Your Base Package
